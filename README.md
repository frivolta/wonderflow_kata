# Install and build

## Install dependencies

Install the dependencies following package lock with npm ci
```
npm ci
```

Build the dist folder:

```

```

## Run the app

You can run the app by running the following command:

```
npm run start
```
the file located at src/index.js will be executed running all the steps together.
You can comment out steps to see single results, the most preferred way is to use:

to see all the test executions.

For any problem regarding installing and running the app I can provide you a docker file to run the app.
